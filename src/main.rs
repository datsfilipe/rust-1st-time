    // we refer to these types by using reference-style syntax that precedes the type with the ampersand &str.
    // We'll cover references in the following modules. For now, you can think of &str as a pointer to immutable string data.
    // String literals are all of type &str.
    // Seems that we won't get a full idea of the difference between String and &str until we learn about Rust's ownership and borrowing system.
