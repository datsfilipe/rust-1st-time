    // strings
    // The str type, also known as a string slice is a view into string data. Most of the time,
    // we refer to these types by using reference-style syntax that precedes the type with the ampersand &str.
    // We'll cover references in the following modules. For now, you can think of &str as a pointer to immutable string data.
    // String literals are all of type &str.
    // Seems that we won't get a full idea of the difference between String and &str until we learn about Rust's ownership and borrowing system.
    let string_1 = "miley ";
    let string_2: &str = "face";
    let string_3 = string_1.to_string() + string_2; // to_string coverts the given value to a String
    println!("{} is a {}{}", smiley_face, uppercase_s as char, string_3); // prints ðŸ˜ƒ is a Smiley face (casting again otherwise it would print the number 83)
